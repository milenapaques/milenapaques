## 🚀 My Key Projects

* **[Complex Scheduling Optimization](https://github.com/milenapaques/Complex-Scheduling-Optimization)**
    * Engineered and implemented Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing from scratch to solve a complex round-robin tournament scheduling problem.

* **[Predictive Maintenance Model](https://github.com/milenapaques/Predictive-Maintenance-SVM)**
    * Developed and trained an SVM model to classify and detect faults in industrial motors. This involved engineering and processing features from real-world sensor data.

* **[Medical Image Processing & Analysis](https://github.com/milenapaques/Medical-Image-Analysis)**
    * Implemented computer vision techniques like image filtering and segmentation. Specialized in medical image analysis, working with DICOM and NIFTI standards for tasks like image registration.
